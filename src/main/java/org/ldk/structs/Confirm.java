/**
 * The `Confirm` trait is used to notify when transactions have been confirmed on chain or
 * unconfirmed during a chain reorganization.
 * 
 * Clients sourcing chain data using a transaction-oriented API should prefer this interface over
 * [`Listen`]. For instance, an Electrum client may implement [`Filter`] by subscribing to activity
 * related to registered transactions and outputs. Upon notification, it would pass along the
 * matching transactions using this interface.
 * 
 * # Use
 * 
 * The intended use is as follows:
 * - Call [`transactions_confirmed`] to process any on-chain activity of interest.
 * - Call [`transaction_unconfirmed`] to process any transaction returned by [`get_relevant_txids`]
 * that has been reorganized out of the chain.
 * - Call [`best_block_updated`] whenever a new chain tip becomes available.
 * 
 * # Order
 * 
 * Clients must call these methods in chain order. Specifically:
 * - Transactions confirmed in a block must be given before transactions confirmed in a later
 * block.
 * - Dependent transactions within the same block must be given in topological order, possibly in
 * separate calls.
 * - Unconfirmed transactions must be given after the original confirmations and before any
 * reconfirmation.
 * 
 * See individual method documentation for further details.

 * [`transaction_unconfirmed`]: Self::transaction_unconfirmed
