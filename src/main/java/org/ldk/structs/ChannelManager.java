/**
 * Manager which keeps track of a number of channels and sends messages to the appropriate
 * channel, also tracking HTLC preimages and forwarding onion packets appropriately.
 * 
 * Implements ChannelMessageHandler, handling the multi-channel parts and passing things through
 * to individual Channels.
 * 
 * Implements Writeable to write out all channel state to disk. Implies peer_disconnected() for
 * all peers during write/read (though does not modify this instance, only the instance being
 * serialized). This will result in any channels which have not yet exchanged funding_created (ie
 * called funding_transaction_generated for outbound channels).
 * 
 * Note that you can be a bit lazier about writing out ChannelManager than you can be with
 * ChannelMonitors. With ChannelMonitors you MUST write each monitor update out to disk before
 * returning from chain::Watch::watch_/update_channel, with ChannelManagers, writing updates
 * happens out-of-band (and will prevent any other ChannelManager operations from occurring during
 * the serialization process). If the deserialized version is out-of-date compared to the
 * ChannelMonitors passed by reference to read(), those channels will be force-closed based on the
 * ChannelMonitor state and no funds will be lost (mod on-chain transaction fees).
 * 
 * Note that the deserializer is only implemented for (BlockHash, ChannelManager), which
 * tells you the last block hash which was block_connect()ed. You MUST rescan any blocks along
 * the \"reorg path\" (ie call block_disconnected() until you get to a common block and then call
 * block_connected() to step towards your best block) upon deserialization before using the
 * object!
 * 
 * Note that ChannelManager is responsible for tracking liveness of its channels and generating
 * ChannelUpdate messages informing peers that the channel is temporarily disabled. To avoid
 * spam due to quick disconnection/reconnection, updates are not sent until the channel has been
 * offline for a full minute. In order to track this, you must call
 * timer_tick_occurred roughly once per minute, though it doesn't have to be perfect.
 * 
 * Rather than using a plain ChannelManager, it is preferable to use either a SimpleArcChannelManager
 * a SimpleRefChannelManager, for conciseness. See their documentation for more details, but
 * essentially you should default to using a SimpleRefChannelManager, and use a
 * SimpleArcChannelManager when you require a ChannelManager with a static lifetime, such as when
 * you're using lightning-net-tokio.

	 *

	 * note that LDK will not stop you from registering duplicate payment hashes for inbound
	 * payments.
	 * 
	 * `min_value_msat` should be set if the invoice being generated contains a value. Any payment
	 * received for the returned [`PaymentHash`] will be required to be at least `min_value_msat`
	 * before a [`PaymentReceived`] event will be generated, ensuring that we do not provide the

	 * 
	 * `invoice_expiry_delta_secs` describes the number of seconds that the invoice is valid for
	 * in excess of the current time. This should roughly match the expiry time set in the invoice.
	 * After this many seconds, we will remove the inbound payment, resulting in any attempts to
	 * pay the invoice failing. The BOLT spec suggests 3,600 secs as a default validity time for
	 * invoices when no timeout is set.
	 * 
	 * Note that we use block header time to time-out pending inbound payments (with some margin
	 * to compensate for the inaccuracy of block header timestamps). Thus, in practice we will
	 * accept a payment and generate a [`PaymentReceived`] event for some time after the expiry.
	 * If you need exact expiry semantics, you should enforce them upon receipt of
	 * [`PaymentReceived`].
